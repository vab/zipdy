About Zipdy
-----------
Zipdy is a program for calculating the distance between two zip
codes and finding all the records in a RDBMS with a zip code
with x miles of another zip code. Currently, RDBMS support
exists for postgreSQL. Additional future support for other
databases will be added in future releases of zipdy.

Zipdy is public domain software. Zipdy was written in C but is
also available in PHP and perl. It runs with data from the US
Census Gazetteer program. The data is from the 2000 census.

The distance calculations are made by doing a great circle
calculation on longitude and latitude points provided by
the census data. The result is returned in standard miles.

Full information about the installation of Zipdy can be
found in the INSTALL file in this directory.
